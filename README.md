# DigitalPlat Domain Website

This repository contains the **official website framework** for DigitalPlat Domain services.

The site is built with **Next.js**, and the visual design is adapted from the **Astro Atom theme** by Tailus UI.
The goal of this project is to provide a clean, fast, and easily extensible foundation for DigitalPlat’s public-facing web presence.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** – React-based framework for production-ready websites
- **TypeScript** – Type safety and better maintainability
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling
- **Astro Atom Theme (Tailus UI)** – Design inspiration and layout reference

Design reference:

- https://github.com/withastro/astro
- https://github.com/Tailus-UI/astro-theme

This project is **not an Astro site**. The original Astro theme was manually adapted and reimplemented for Next.js.

## Project Purpose

This repository focuses on:

- A reusable homepage layout for DigitalPlat-related services
- Clear content structure for domains, products, and documentation
- Minimal dependencies and long-term maintainability
- Easy customization for future sub-projects and microsites

It is intended to be used as a **base framework**, not a locked-down template.
